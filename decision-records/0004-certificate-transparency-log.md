# 4. Certificate Transparency Log

Date: 2025-09-02

## Status

Approved

## Context

To ensure the integrity and auditability of the PKI system, all certificate issuance and revocation events must be recorded in a secure and tamper-evident manner. This is critical for security audits and for maintaining trust in the certificates generated by the system.

## Decision

We will implement a dedicated Certificate Transparency (CT) service. This service will expose an APPEND-ONLY log API. The `signing` service will be the only component permitted to write to this log, recording every certificate it signs or revokes. All other services will have read-only access.

## Consequence

This creates a verifiable and immutable audit trail for all certificate lifecycle events, enhancing the overall security posture. The append-only nature ensures that history cannot be altered, only corrected by appending new records. This design requires careful handling of potential duplicate write requests in the event of network failures to maintain data integrity.
