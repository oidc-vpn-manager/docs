# 1. We will use Decision Records.

Date: 2025-09-02

## Status

Approved

## Context

We need to record the decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architectural Decision Records (ADR), as described by [Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). We use the term "Decision Records" (DR) and "Architectural Decision Records" interchangably, as we want to record all decisions, not just architectural ones.

## Consequence

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
